Hey there <b>{NAME}</b> !

March's Theme is Reader's Choice for both BOTM-Fiction and BOTM-NonFiction.
This idea came up in one of our voice chats and we remembered that and decided to honor that suggestion. So we thought why not give you guys a chance to suggest anything and everything.

<b>So what are you waiting for?</b>
Suggest any book of your choice for any or both of our genres.
Get started by clicking on the respective genre:
 ‣ /fiction
 ‣ /nonfiction 

If you are stuck use /help.
Thanks.
