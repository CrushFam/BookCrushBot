Hey there <b>{NAME}</b>!

Welcome to <b>September</b>.

<i>Just September</i>? Not really! We have got a lot of plans for this month, but as we are limited by nature to allow only two genres (one for fiction and one for non-fiction). So with the same big plans for next month too, let us pass September with two completely brand new genres.
<b>Fiction</b> - <b>Dystopia</b>
<b>Non-Fiction</b> - <b>No Genre</b>

Get started by clicking on the respective genre:
‣ /fiction
‣ /nonfiction

<b>Short Story Senpais</b>, check out /shortstory!

If you are stuck use /help.
Thanks.
