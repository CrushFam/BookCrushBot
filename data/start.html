Hey there <b>{NAME}</b> !

Welcome to <b>May of Many</b>.

After a lot of ups and downs in life, we all are waiting for some <i>magic</i> to happen...
Though we are not powerful enough to make it out, we can for sure dedicate a month to magic!
Unfortunately, non-fiction doesn't allow magic yet... so with a cruel heart, we chose murder for the real side!

<b>Mighty May</b> is going to be awesome with <b>magic</b> for <b>fiction</b> and <b>murder</b> for <b>non-fiction</b>!!

<b>So what are you waiting for?</b>
