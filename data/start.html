We call a few, a very few as <code>winners</code>. They get the title of <u>real heroes</u>.

Now the question comes ... did every human become a winner ? Surely not !
Enough <i>philosophy</i>, let's get to the matter.

<b>We believe books have lives.</b>
They can speak and guide you to a <i>parallel universe</i> that may not have even existed.
