<b>BookCrushBot</b> lets you suggest book of the month (<i>BOTM</i>) for both <code>Fiction</code> and <code>Non-Fiction</code>.
Under any circumstance, if you feel something is wrong, can be improved, feel free to contact
the developers.

I have the following commands using which we can communicate.

∙ /start - Presents a gentle greeting with latest news.
∙ /help - Gets the help message (literally this message).
∙ /fiction - Use this to suggest books and edit the suggested ones for <code>Fiction</code>.
∙ /nonfiction - Books for  <code>Non-Fiction</code> can be added and edited here.
∙ /shortstory - Short story suggestions can be added and edited here.

Thanks to [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org) for their API.

Enjoy !
