*BookCrushBot* lets you suggest book of the month (_BOTM_), make review of books you have read and add your favourite books to the _Roulette_.
Under any circumstance, if you feel something is wrong, can be improved, feel free to contact
the developers.

I have the following commands using which we can communicate.

  ∙ /start - Presents a gentle greeting with latest news.
  ∙ /contact - Shows the information required to contact the developers.
  ∙ /guide - Tells you a little more about adding and removing books.
  ∙ /help - Gets the help message (literally this message).
  ∙ /botm - Use this to suggest books and edit the suggested ones for _BOTM_.
  ∙ /review - Share review of books you have read. 
  ∙ /roulette - Add your preferred books to the _Roulette_ using this command.

Thanks to [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org) for their API.

Enjoy !
