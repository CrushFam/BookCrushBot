*BookCrushBot* lets you suggest book of the month \(_BOTM_\) and add your favourite books to the _Roulette_\.
Under any circumstance, if you feel something is wrong, can be improved, feel free to contact
the developers\.

I have the following commands using which we can communicate\.

  ∙ /start \- Presents a gentle greeting with latest news\.
  ∙ /contact \- Shows the information required to contact the developers\.
  ∙ /guide \- Tells you a little more about adding and removing books\.
  ∙ /help \- Gets the help message \(literally this message\)\.
  ∙ /botm \- Use this to suggest books and edit the suggested ones for _BOTM_\.
  ∙ /roulette \- Add your preferred books to the _Roulette_ using this command\.

Please be aware that while adding books for _BOTM_ and _Roulette_, if you are not active for more than five minutes, your session will expire\. The same will happen if you try to start or restart the same or another session\.

Thanks to [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org) for their API\.

Enjoy \!
